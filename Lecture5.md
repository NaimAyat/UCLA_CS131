## Types
* Roles:
  * Annotation
    * For programmers
    * For compilers
  * Inference
    * Can infer types from other information
* Time: 
  * Dynamic vs. static time-checking
    * Dynamic = more flexible, simpler in practice
    * Static = more reliable
* Strongly-typed languages: you cannot escape type checking
  * Ex. OCaml is strongly typed. C is not; you can subvert type checking with pointers.
    ```
    
    ```
* Type equivalence
  * Structural equivalence: types are the same if their layout or operations are the same
    * Layout: applies to exposed-type languages
    * Operations: applies to languages with information hiding
  * Name equivalence: must have same names

## Parallelism
