## Chapter 1
### 1.2 Variety
* Imperative language: supports assignment and iteration (ex. C)
* Functional language: supports recursion and single-valued variables (ex. ML, Lisp)
  * Recursion is as natural in ML as iteration is in C
* Logic language: programs written in terms of rules about logical inference (ex. Prolog)
  * Not well-suited for computing mathematical functions
* Object-oriented language: in addition to being imperative, it is easier to define objects (ex. C++, Java)
* Multi-paradigm languages: attempt to combine features of multiple language types (ex. JavaScript, OCaml, Python)
### 1.3 Controversies
* The definition of *object-oriented* is heavily debated; some languages may be considered more object-oriented than others
### 1.4 Evolution
* Good languages can evolve new dialects (ex. Fortran II through Fortran 2008)
### 1.5 Connections
* It is best to adapt programming style to the language in use (ex. write many small functions in ML, use objects in Java)
